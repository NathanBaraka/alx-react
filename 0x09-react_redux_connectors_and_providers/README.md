# React Redux Connectors and Providers

This project implements Redux in a React application, connecting the `uiReducer` to the `App` component using the `connect` function from `react-redux`.

## Steps Implemented:

1. Installed `react-redux` to connect Redux state to React components.
2. Created `mapStateToProps` in `App.js` to map `isLoggedIn` state from `uiReducer` to the component's props.
3. Connected the `App` component to the Redux store using the `connect` function.

## Files updated:
- `src/App/App.js`
- `src/reducers/uiReducer.js`
